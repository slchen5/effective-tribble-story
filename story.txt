George was a dude who lived in the far off land of Illinois. One day he learned of a glorious land called Wisconsin. He moved to Wisconsin.
Several years later he got married with a girl from NewYork, US.
In the first few years of his marriage, he loves the virtuousness of his wife. But gradually he become bored with this peaceful life. He hopes to find another beautiful girl and experience romantic love.

Luckily, George realized that there was only one more paragraph available in his story.
Instead of leaving his wife, he worked a comfortable job at the post office for 35 years.  While he and his wife never had any children,
they always made themselves available to coach little league, cook pancake breakfasts, and generally socialize with the community.
George passed away at the age of 87, followed shortly by his wife.  With their savings, they started a small scholarship program for local school children to have equally uneventful, but altogether pleasant lives.
